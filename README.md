# ClickEvents

In this programming exercise you will be practicing click events.

Your finished product should be a Github URL with one HTML and one JavaScript file inside it (One per group, collaborate on the assignment).

In this activity you should only have an empty main tag in your HTML. All of the other HTML on your page should be created with JavaScript.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Make an empty HTML file, put three buttons inside the body and an empty main tag below the buttons.

The text of the buttons should be "Foo", "Bar", and "FooBar" respectively. Don't put the " in the buttons that's just for clarification in these instructions.
Add unique IDs to each button

In your JavaScript, get 3 separate references to the buttons using the IDs you made and store them in variables. You should use either document.querySelector or document.getElementByID, both will work.

Create a click event listener on each button.

When the "Foo" button is clicked, an h3 with the text "Foo" should be created and appended to the main tag.
When the "Bar" button is clicked, an h3 with the text "Bar" should be created and appended to the main tag.
When the "Foobar" button is clicked, an h2 with the text "FooBar" should be created and appended to the main tag.
